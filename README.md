#  ITSE_2359_271 - UNIT 2 - Project by Jonathan Ortiz - 1st Revision - 02/08/2026
> Repo for Week 3 &amp; 4 project on GameStat Character Manager 

# _Objective_
> This project focuses on creating a menu-driven console application for a game character creator. 

# _How it works_
> Based on your input, you will be taken throughout 5 different menu options to do the following:
  1. Create a character
  2. View your character's base stats
  3. Calculate combat stats
  4. Level up your character
  5. Exit the program

# _New Fixes for 1st Revision_
> The next step in development was to add more input validation, as well as a more complete and cleaner program including:
 - Ability to add spaces into character name
 - rejects invalid input in main menu
 - stats refresh when creating new character
 - level-up prevents stat increasing issues, (unless the user works around its logic)

# _Current Issues_
> Despite the lack of syntax errors, there are still many logical errors to be acknowledged and resolved. As of now, these include:
- Combat stats will only increase if choice 3 of the main menu is chosen, regardless of character's level
- You can level up a character, even if you have not created one
