#  ITSE_2359_271 - UNIT 2 - Project by Jonathan Ortiz
> Repo for Week 3 &amp; 4 project on GameStat Character Manager 

# _Objective_
> This project focuses on creating a menu-driven console application for a game character creator. 

# _How it works_
> Based on your input, you will be taken throughout 5 different menu options to do the following:
  1. Create a character
  2. View your character's base stats
  3. Calculate combat stats
  4. Level up your character
  5. Exit the program

# _Current Issues_
> Despite the lack of syntax errors, there are still many logical errors to be acknowledged and resolved. As of now, these include:
- Stats still increase in character level up regardless of added do-while loop, intended to prevent added stats after reaching max level.
- Stats will still show regardless of whether or not the user created a character.

# _Future Additions_
> The next step in developing this application would be to add more input validation, as well as other features which include:
 - a parallel array to store multiple characters
 - combat stat calculations to compare stats and powerscaling
 - view different desired character stats
